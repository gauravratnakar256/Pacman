The projected is been sourced from [The Pacman Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) by the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/). In this project the goals are to learn how to implement some of the searches we have learned in class in a fun game. We have implemented Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, A* search, Uniform Cost Search, a greedy search, and various heuristics and be able to see first hand what each search is good at and gain a better understanding.
